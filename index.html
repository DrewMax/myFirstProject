                <br>
            <p>Why does this website look like a child made it? simple answer.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I made this website using code. My old blog was made through wordpress 
                which was wonderful but I am teaching myself code and transforming 
                my blog is my first "project" so as time goes on this blog will 
                start to look better and better. 
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>i am learnign code to change my life. with Covid destroying the hospitality 
                industry, going online sounds like a good way to stay ahead during these troubling 
                times. i have never had a passion for coding but as i learn it, i am discovering 
                a passion for it. it is a little complicated but i have made it this far.
